# Controller Mouse Emulator

## Description

Program that controls mouse movement, clicks, and scrolling using an xbox controller.

## Background

Written in January of 2016 as a tool of convenience to allow me to lean back in my chair and use my computer out of reach of my keyboard and mouse.

## Building

This program was made with Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013, and must be built exclusively with Visual Studio on Windows. This is due to the dependency on XInput for its XBox controller API.

## Controls

- Left thumbstick to move the mouse around
- Right thumbstick to scroll the scrollwheel
- Use the left and right trigger to change mouse movement speed
- Press A to left click
- Press B to right click
- Click the right thumbstick to middle click
